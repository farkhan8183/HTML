                <h2> About me: </h2>
                <p>Hello, I'm farhan, a dedicated and driven individual currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. My journey into the world of technology began with a curiosity about how things work and a desire to solve complex problems. This passion led me to explore various aspects of computing, from programming to web development.

                    I have always been fascinated by the potential of technology to transform ideas into reality. Over the years, I have developed a strong foundation in several programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and C++. These skills have enabled me to create dynamic and engaging web applications, and I continue to expand my knowledge by delving into new technologies and methodologies.
                    
                    One of my key interests is web development. I find joy in designing and building websites that are not only functional but also visually appealing. My experience with HTML and CSS has allowed me to craft responsive and user-friendly websites, while my knowledge of JavaScript and C++ enhances my ability to develop interactive features and applications.
                    
                    In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong advocate for continuous learning. I regularly take on new challenges, whether through personal projects, internships, or online courses. This proactive approach helps me stay updated with the latest industry trends and best practices, ensuring that my skills remain relevant and sharp.
                    
                    Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy engaging in activities that foster creativity and personal growth. I am an avid reader, with a particular interest in technology and science fiction. I also love cycling and hiking, which provide me with a refreshing break from screen time and an opportunity to appreciate the beauty of nature.
                    
                    As I move forward in my career, I am excited about the prospect of contributing to innovative projects and collaborating with like-minded professionals. I am confident that my blend of technical expertise, enthusiasm, and commitment to excellence will enable me to make a meaningful impact in the field of technology.
                    
                    Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting with you and exploring new opportunities in the ever-evolving world of tech </p>
